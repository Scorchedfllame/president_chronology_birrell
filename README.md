# President Chronology Quizzes

This is for your studying for all future chronology quizzes. This page will be updated periodically with the new study sets.
It's a little bit better than quizlet in my opinion because you are actually typing out the answers.

To run this program you will need the latest version of python on your PC.

Once you have python installed just run main.py and start studying!

The Python download is here: https://www.python.org/downloads/
